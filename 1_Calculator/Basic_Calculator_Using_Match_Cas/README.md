# ðŸ§® Basic Calculator Using Match Case

### âœ… Project Type: Made by Myself

This is a simple Python-based calculator that uses the `match-case` statement (Python 3.10+) to perform basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with exception handling for division by zero)
- Clean CLI-based user interface

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3.10+
- Match-case control structure
- Exception handling

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. Takes two numeric inputs from the user.
2. Asks the user to select an operation:
   - 1: Addition
   - 2: Subtraction
   - 3: Multiplication
   - 4: Division
3. Performs the operation using Python's `match-case` statement.
4. Handles division-by-zero errors gracefully.

## ðŸ§ª Example

```bash
Enter The Value of a: 10
Enter The Value of b: 5
Enter 1 for Addition
Enter 2 for Subtraction
Enter 3 for Multiplication
Enter 4 for Division
3
The Multiplication of a and b is 50
