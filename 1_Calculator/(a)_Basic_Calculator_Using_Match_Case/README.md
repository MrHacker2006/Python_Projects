# Basic Calculator using Match Case ðŸ§®

### âœ… Project Type: Made by Myself

This is a simple calculator I built using Pythonâ€™s `match-case` feature, which is similar to switch-case in other programming languages. It takes two numbers from the user and performs a basic arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, or divide) based on their choice.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with error handling for division by zero)
- Simple, easy-to-use input system
- Built using the new `match-case` syntax introduced in Python 3.10+

## ðŸ“Œ How to Use

1. Run the script in any terminal that supports Python.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. Choose the operation by entering a number (1 to 4).
4. Get the result based on your input.

Example:

```bash
Enter The Value of a: 12
Enter The Value of b: 4
Enter 1 for Addition
Enter 2 for Subtraction
Enter 3 for Multiplication
Enter 4 for Division
2
The Subtraction of a and b is 8
