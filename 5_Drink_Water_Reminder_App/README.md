# 💧 Water Reminder Notifier in Python

### 🤝Project Type: Made with Help

This is a simple Python script that acts like your personal hydration assistant. It sends a desktop notification **every hour** to remind you to drink water — helping you stay healthy and hydrated during your busy schedule.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Displays a friendly message on your terminal:  
  `"Please Drink Some Water."`

- Sends a **desktop notification** with the title and message:
  - **Title**: Please drink some water
  - **Message**: You need to drink some water right now

- Repeats this **every hour (60 minutes)** using a continuous loop.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x

- plyer library (for cross-platform notifications)

- This script will run indefinitely, sending notifications every hour until you manually stop it (Ctrl + C).

- plyer works on Windows, macOS, and Linux — but make sure notifications are enabled on your system.
