# 🎯 Console Quiz Game in Python

### 🤝Project Type: Made with Help

This is a simple yet fun **multiple-choice quiz game** built using Python. Each round asks the user a general knowledge question with four answer options. Answer correctly to win increasing cash prizes — but one wrong answer and the game ends!

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The quiz randomly selects and shuffles a list of **20 general knowledge questions**.
- Each question has **4 multiple-choice options**.
- The user is asked to input the correct option number (`1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`).
- For every correct answer, the user wins a progressively larger **cash prize**.
- If the user gives a wrong answer, the game stops and reveals the correct option.
